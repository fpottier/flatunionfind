(**This module offers a union-find data structure based on disjoint set
   forests, with path compression and linking by rank. The data structure
   is stored in a flat integer vector. *)

(**Applying the functor [Make] creates a fresh instance of the union-find
   data structure. This functor is generative: each application returns a
   new module, with its own mutable internal state and its own abstract type
   [point]. *)

(**Applying the functor [MakeWithData] creates a fresh instance of the
   union-find data structure. In comparison with [Make], this data structure
   offers one additional feature: it maintains a map of equivalence classes
   to user data. This functor is generative: each application returns a new
   module, with its own mutable internal state and its own abstract type
